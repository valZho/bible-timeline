        "Plotting Biblical dates can be tedious and difficult. First of all, there are just <i>so many</i> dates to keep track of, but moreso, everything is in relation to everything else. For example, to get the year Joseph was born: we see that it was 30 years prior to the 14-year period of feast and famine in Egypt ... which began 9 years prior to Jacob's arrival there ... which happened 17 years before his death ... which was 147 years after his birth ... which happened 60 years after Isaac's birth ... which was 100 years after Abraham's birth ... and on and on back to Adam which ultimately establishes <i>all</i> the dates on the calendar. Whew!",

        "After trying to \"check the math\", so to speak, on one author's claims, I realized that a computer could do this stuff much easier than me, and being a web developer, I decided it would be a fun little project to take on. Very quickly I realized that there are a lot of opinions and assumptions out there regarding Biblical dates, and nothing is <i>quite</i> as clean and clear-cut as you might think. So I decided to just add that variability as options with the benefit of getting to see what the different assumptions do to the timeline in relation to everything else.",

        "As stated above, every date on the calendar is ultimately calculated relationally from Adam all the way to the Crucifixion using just the Bible. Once all the Biblical dates are calculated, I then use the user setting for the Gregorian date of the Crucifixion to then calculate and add all of the Gregorian dates to all of the events. Also once this is done, I am able to add secular, Gregorian-only dates to the timeline as well.",

        "Applying this to a Biblical example, in Gen5:32 when we read, \"<i>Noah was 500 years old, and he fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth,</i>\" we must understand that it is meaning that he was \"in his 500th year\" even though we would recon him to be 499 years old by our exclusive thinking.",

Starting with Adam, by the time you get to Christ, you are looking at a swing of more than two decades on your dates. While this margin of error is hidden by default, it's important to remember that they are there and any impression of fine precision you might have is actually a bit of an illusion.

        "There can be a little bit of confusion about the time from Abraham to the Exodus. When was Abraham called by God? How long were the Israelites sojourning (as some translations put it) in Egypt? At first glance, it seems like there are three irreconcilable time periods: 400, 430, and 450 years, but with a little digging we can make some sense out of it.",

        "Our first number, and the one where the translation you use can make a big difference, comes in Gen15:13 (and Acts7:6), \"Know this for certain: Your offspring will be resident aliens for <strong>four hundred years</strong> in a land that does not belong to them and will be enslaved and oppressed.\"",

        "Many translations read something like, \"they will be enslaved for 400 years,\" which leaves little wiggle room. However, some translations, like the CSB above, do a little bit better job of capturing the parenthetical nature of \"enslaved and opressed\". We are being told that Abraham's offspring will be <i>resident aliens</i> for 400 years, and that, during some portion of that time, they will be enslaved and opressed. Much like someone who is told, \"you will go to an all day event and will have lunch,\" wouldn't expect to be eating for 8 hours.",

        "Instead of looking for the onset of the oppression and trying to start this 400 year period perhaps when Joseph gets sold into slavery in Egypt, or maybe some other nebulous time later, we should instead look for the moment when Abraham's offspring became resident aliens — which has an obvious and exact date in my opinion: Isaac was <i>born</i> as a resident alien, so his birth seems to be the best fit. If it weren't obvious enough from context, in Gen21 where we read about Isaac's birth, the Bible <i>explicitely</i> calls out in verse 23, almost as a reminder, that Abraham and his family were indeed resident aliens <i>at that time</i>.",

        "Our next number comes from Acts13:17-20 which tells us that the time in Egypt + the time wandering the desert + the time taking the promised land took \"<strong><i>about</i></strong> 450 years\" (emphasis added). We can surmise through an examination through the book of Joshua that the taking of the land should be close to about seven years, which does fit within Paul's rounded \"about 450\" number and lines up well with our 400-year time period.",

        "Finally, if we head over to NET|Exo12:40-41, we read that the time that the Israelite people were in Egypt was 430 years. This turns out to be problematic in a couple of different ways. Our first problem is that it presents a time in Egypt that is far longer than fits with the two dates we've already established.",

        "To solve this, let's take a look at a couple of relavant passages in the new testament. In Gal3:16-17 Paul states that the law was given 430 years after <i>the promise</i>, and Acts7:2 reminds us that the promise was given while Abraham was still in Mesopotamia (Haran); the promise must have been given, <i>at a minimum</i>, 190 years prior to Joseph being taken into Egypt. In other words, the 430 years <i>must</i> include Abraham's time in Canaan. Indeed, when we go back and look at the Exodus verse in the Septuagint, we can see that it includes \"...<i>and in Canaan</i>...\" where the Masoretic Text does not.",

        "With that problem solved, our second arises. Gen12:4 tells us that Abraham was 75 years old when he left Haran — 25 years before the birth of Isaac. What are we to do, then, with the extra 5 years that arises between \"the promise\" being 30 years prios to Isaac, but Isaac being born only 25 years after Abraham left Haran? There are a couple of ways that this can be resolved:",

        "<0><0></0> <strong>$t(options.sojourn.title):</strong></0>",

        "<0>$t(options.sojourn.early)</0> — This is the stronger option in my opinion. You can either read Gen12:1-4 as \"God called Abraham out of Haran with a promise, and some time later Abraham left.\" which places the promise about five years prior to Abraham leaving Haran, or there is some Greek textual support for reading Acts7:4 such that Abraham left Haran prior to his father's death. Whether he left before his father died or waited a while after the promise has interesting theological implications (you could get a sermon out of either of those), the effect on the timeline either way is the same.",

        "<0>$t(options.sojourn.late)</0> — If the Promise, Abraham's departure, and Haran's death were indeed all the same year, then you must push back the beginning of the 400 and 450 year periods to begin when Isaac was about 5 years old. Some have tried to argue that this has to do with higher infant mortality rates and that the Israelites wouldn't count a person until after their 4th or 5th year, but I personally am unable to find any independent support for that assertion."
