      "description_wTags": "It is important to understand that the Bible uses an <strong><i>inclusive</i></strong> reconing of time which can be foreign to our modern, Western, <i>exclusive</i> reconing about time.<br /><br />To illustrate, only a full year after birth would we moderns say that a baby is one year old, i.e., they have been alive for a year. In Ancient Isreal, as soon as they were born, it would have been said that they were one, i.e., they were in their first year.<br /><br />Applying this to a Biblical example, in Gen5:32 when we read, \"<i>Noah was 500 years old, and he fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth,</i>\" we moderns should understand it to mean that he was what we would call 499 years old and \"in his 500th year\" when he became a father. This has obvious implications on dates, and is something to keep in mind."

Fast forward to 2024, where I have revisited the idea, but this time set out to build it properly — from the ground up, with modern web dev tools — into something that will hopefully be more usable for, not just me, but anyone who might find it useful!",

In other words, <i>I am in no way claiming any sort of expertise on this topic</i> ... but I'm also not claiming to come to this completely without opinion either. Mostly, though, I just wanted to do something with my development skills that might help someone else. Feel free to send me a message if you think there's something that could be improved or added, or if you are so inclined and able, the code for this project is available on Github for you to fork and tinker around with yourself.",

In particular, I have heavily referenced <0>the work of Henry B. Smith Jr. of the Associates of Biblical Research</0> on the topic, and the \"$t(options.ages.best)\" option is based on his assertions: mostly following the LXX.<br /><br />It's important to note that, despite the preponderance of evidence, and by what I would consider a quirk of history, all English bible translations — even the most recent (and I can't speak for translations in other languages) — are still using the ages found in the MT.<br /><br />I recommend keeping this option set to \"$t(options.ages.best)\", but I have included the ability to set the timeline to use solely the MT or the LXX for the patriarch ages.",

This is inescapable by virtue of how the Bible lists birth years in Genesis; the Bible will list the year a person had their first child, but was that child born at the beginning of that year, the end, or somewhere in the middle? Naturally, that places a ±6mo margin of error on all dates of birth for the patriarchs (save Adam) which compounds to about a ±10yr margin of error for all subsequent dates.<br /><br />A common method around this is to just assume that placing all of these birth dates at the middle of the year will more-or-less average itself out. Technically it's less precise, but likely gets you pretty close — in essence, the margins of error are still there, you just won't see them.",

Below are the three different methods for calculating the jubilee year that I have seen floating around out there:<br /><br /><strong>• Inclusive:</strong> Each jubilee year overlaps with each 49th (<i>shmita</i>) year.<br /><br /><strong>• Exclusive:</strong> Each jubilee year begins <i>after</i> each 49th (<i>shmita</i>) year and overlaps with the 1st year of each new shmita cycle (49-year cycles)<br /><br /><strong>• Intercalated:</strong> Each jubilee year begins <i>after</i> the 49th (<i>shmita</i>) year and interrupts the shmita cycle with an intercalated (inserted) year. The first year of the next shmita cycle begins <i>after</i> the jubilee year (50-year cycles)",
