In particular, I have heavily referenced <0>the work of Henry B. Smith Jr. of the Associates of Biblical Research</0> on the topic, and the \"$t(options.ages.best)\" option is based on his assertions: mostly following the LXX, but <br /><br />Despite the preponderance of evidence, and by what I would consider a quirk of history, all English bible translations — even the most recent (and I can't speak for translations in other languages) — are still using the ages found in the MT.<br /><br />I recommend keeping this option set to \"$t(options.ages.best)\", but it can be useful to force it to use solely the MT or the LXX.",

      "description_wTags": "When constructing a Biblical timeline there is going to be some margin of error on <i>all</i> of your dates. This is inescapable by virtue of how the Bible lists birth years in Genesis; the Bible will list the year a person had their first child, but was that child born at the beginning of that year, the end, or somewhere in the middle? Naturally, that places a ±6mo margin of error on all dates of birth for the patriarchs (save Adam) which compounds to about a ±10yr margin of error for all subsequent dates.<br /><br />A common method around this is to just assume that placing all of these birth dates at the middle of the year will more-or-less average itself out. Technically it's less precise, but likely gets you pretty close — in essence, the margins of error are still there, you just won't see them.",
